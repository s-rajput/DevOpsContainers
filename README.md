# DevOps Containers
This repo demonstrates CI/CD pipelines to perform the build, run the tests, creating docker containers,pushing them into docker registry before deploying them to azure using azure devops.
EF migrations are performed to create initial schema and to add index. The Swagger documentation generator is added and server header is removed from api response for security purposes.

## Demo :wave:

# DevOps Containers

## Overview

**DevOps Containers** is a demonstration repository showcasing best practices for building, testing, containerizing, and deploying .NET applications using modern DevOps workflows. This project leverages Azure DevOps CI/CD pipelines to automate the entire lifecycleâ€”from code build and testing to Docker image creation, registry management, and deployment to Azure. The repository also includes Entity Framework migrations, API documentation via Swagger, and security enhancements.

---

## Features

- **Automated CI/CD Pipelines:**  
  End-to-end automation using Azure DevOps for building, testing, containerizing, and deploying applications.

- **Docker Containerization:**  
  Application is packaged into Docker containers for consistency across environments.

- **Docker Registry Integration:**  
  Built images are pushed to a Docker registry (Azure Container Registry or Docker Hub).

- **Azure Deployment:**  
  Automated deployment of containers to Azure services (e.g., Azure App Service or Azure Kubernetes Service).

- **Entity Framework Migrations:**  
  Database schema is managed using EF Core migrations, including initial schema creation and index addition.

- **API Documentation with Swagger:**  
  Integrated Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for easy API exploration and testing.

- **Security Hardening:**  
  Removes the `Server` header from API responses to reduce information exposure.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) (for manual Azure interactions)
- Azure DevOps account (for CI/CD pipelines)
- Access to a Docker registry (Azure Container Registry or Docker Hub)

### Setup & Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/s-rajput/DevOpsContainers.git
    cd DevOpsContainers
    ```

2. **Build the Application Locally**
    ```
    dotnet build
    ```

3. **Run Tests**
    ```
    dotnet test
    ```

4. **Run Entity Framework Migrations**
    ```
    dotnet ef database update
    ```

5. **Build and Run Docker Container Locally**
    ```
    docker build -t devopscontainers:latest .
    docker run -p 8080:80 devopscontainers:latest
    ```

6. **Access API Documentation**
    - Visit `http://localhost:8080/swagger` in your browser after running the container.

## CI/CD with Azure DevOps

The repository includes sample Azure DevOps pipeline YAML files to automate:

- Building and testing the application
- Creating and pushing Docker images to a registry
- Running EF Core migrations
- Deploying containers to Azure

**To use:**
- Import the pipeline YAML into your Azure DevOps project.
- Set up required pipeline secrets (e.g., registry credentials, Azure service connection).
- Trigger the pipeline on code commits or pull requests.

---

## Security Considerations

- The API removes the `Server` header from responses to minimize information leakage.
- Store secrets and credentials in Azure DevOps Pipeline secrets or Azure Key Vault.
- Regularly update dependencies and base images to patch vulnerabilities.
